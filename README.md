# Module M2 Indexing Products (Add-On: Exclude Visibility)

Magento V4 Add-on Submodule to exclude products being indexed based on visibility.

Installing this module into a Magento instance where multiple stores are integrated with the same Klevu Auth Keys 
will likely cause unexpected behaviour and is not recommended.

This is a sub package to the klevu-m2-search repository.
Please, see klevu-m2-search/README.md for more information on how to install the overall extension.
